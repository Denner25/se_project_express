# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the 12th project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It's a back-end project focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The learning experience provided a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database for storing users and clothing items
- **Mongoose** — ODM for MongoDB, used for schema definitions and data validation
